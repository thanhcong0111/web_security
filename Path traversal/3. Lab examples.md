# Some cases of Path traversal

## 1. File path traversal, simple case

Use Burp Suite to intercept and modify a request that fetches a product image.

Modify the filename parameter, giving it the value:`../../../etc/passwd`

Observe that the response contains the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file.

## 2. File path traversal, traversal sequences blocked with absolute path bypass.

The URL will take the filename parameter to return the contents of that file. Therefore, we can follow  URL path to retrieve the contents of the `/etc/passwd file` from the server's filesystem.

Insert the URL `filename=/etc/passwd` to retrieve the data from the file.

## 3. File path traversal, traversal sequences stripped non-recursively

Use Burp Suite to intercept and modify a request that fetches a product image.

Modify the filename parameter, giving it the value: `....//....//....//etc/passwd`

Observe that the response contains the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file.

## 4. File path traversal, traversal sequences stripped with superfluous URL-decode

Use Burp Suite to intercept and modify a request that fetches a product image.

Modify the filename parameter, giving it the value:`..%252f..%252f..%252fetc/passwd`

Observe that the response contains the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file.

## 5. File path traversal, validation of start of path

Use Burp Suite to intercept and modify a request that fetches a product image.

Modify the filename parameter, giving it the value:`/var/www/images/../../../etc/passwd`

Observe that the response contains the contents of the `/etc/passwd file`.

## 6. File path traversal, validation of file extension with null byte bypass

Use Burp Suite to intercept and modify a request that fetches a product image.

Modify the filename parameter, giving it the value:`../../../etc/passwd%00.png`

Observe that the response contains the contents of the `/etc/passwd file`.
