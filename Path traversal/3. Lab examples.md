# Some cases of Path traversal

## 1. File path traversal, traversal sequences blocked with absolute path bypass.

The URL will take the filename parameter to return the contents of that file. Therefore, we can follow  URL path to retrieve the contents of the `/etc/passwd file` from the server's filesystem.

Insert the URL `filename=/etc/passwd` to retrieve the data from the file.

## 2. File path traversal, traversal sequences stripped non-recursively

Use `'.. /'` to move up to 1 level of parent folder. Sometimes use `'....//'` or 
`'â€¦./'`

Example: The original path is `folder1/folder2/etc/passwd`. After using `'.. /'` then 
`folder1/folder2/.. /etc/passwd` after being processed, it will be `folder1/etc/passwd`.

URL encoding can be used to bypass the case where the web server removes all sequences of
transmission before passing the input data to the application.

Use null bytes in cases where the web server requires the filename parameter to be present 
extensions, e.g. .png. Then use null bytes to bypass the path check and subsequent file sections.
