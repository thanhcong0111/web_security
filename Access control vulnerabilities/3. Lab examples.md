Log on to the account with `username = wiener` and `password = peter`. Then look in the Burp Proxy section `/login` and you will get the following information: `Set-Cookie: Admin=false`

To change it to true, we find the `/my-account` part and do `Send to repeater` to
carry out an attack.

After `Send to repeater`, we found that there are not exist any admins. Therefore, change `Admin=true` and resend. The result is: 
```
<a href="/admin">
  Admin panel
</a>
```

Next, to change the content of website, just open running cookies and change the admin value to true.

Clicking on `My account` again will bring up the `Admin panel`. So at this time, we have 
successfully seized power. According to the lab request, click `Delete carlos` and you are complete sincere
