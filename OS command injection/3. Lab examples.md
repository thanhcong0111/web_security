# Some cases of OS command 

## 1. OS command injection, simple case

Use Burp Suite to intercept and modify a request that checks the stock level.

Modify the storeID parameter, giving it the value `1|whoami`.

Observe that the response contains the name of the current user.

## 2. Blind OS command injection with time delays

Use Burp Suite to intercept and modify the request that submits feedback.

Modify the email parameter, changing it to:

`email=x||ping+-c+10+127.0.0.1||`

Observe that the response takes 10 seconds to return.

## 3. Blind OS command injection with output redirection

Use Burp Suite to intercept and modify the request that submits feedback.

Modify the email parameter, changing it to:

`email=||whoami>/var/www/images/output.txt||`

Now use Burp Suite to intercept and modify the request that loads an image of a product.

Modify the filename parameter, changing the value to the name of the file you specified for the output of the injected command:

`filename=output.txt`

Observe that the response contains the output from the injected command.
