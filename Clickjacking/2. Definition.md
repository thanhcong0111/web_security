# What is clickjacking?

Clickjacking is an interface-based attack in which a user is tricked into clicking on actionable content on a hidden website by clicking on some other content in a decoy website. Consider the following example:

A web user accesses a decoy website (perhaps this is a link provided by an email) and clicks on a button to win a prize. Unknowingly, they have been deceived by an attacker into pressing an alternative hidden button and this results in the payment of an account on another site. This is an example of a clickjacking attack. The technique depends upon the incorporation of an invisible, actionable web page (or multiple pages) containing a button or hidden link, say, within an iframe. The iframe is overlaid on top of the user's anticipated decoy web page content. This attack differs from a [CSRF](https://portswigger.net/web-security/csrf) attack in that the user is required to perform an action such as a button click whereas a [CSRF attack](https://portswigger.net/web-security/csrf) depends upon forging an entire request without the user's knowledge or input.

Protection against CSRF attacks is often provided by the use of a [CSRF token](https://portswigger.net/web-security/csrf#common-defences-against-csrf): a session-specific, single-use number or nonce. Clickjacking attacks are not mitigated by the CSRF token as a target session is established with content loaded from an authentic website and with all requests happening on-domain. CSRF tokens are placed into requests and passed to the server as part of a normally behaved session. The difference compared to a normal user session is that the process occurs within a hidden iframe.
