# What is clickjacking?

Clickjacking is an interface-based attack in which a user is tricked into clicking on actionable content on a hidden website by clicking on some other content in a decoy website. Consider the following example:

A web user accesses a decoy website (perhaps this is a link provided by an email) and clicks on a button to win a prize. Unknowingly, they have been deceived by an attacker into pressing an alternative hidden button and this results in the payment of an account on another site. This is an example of a clickjacking attack. The technique depends upon the incorporation of an invisible, actionable web page (or multiple pages) containing a button or hidden link, say, within an iframe. The iframe is overlaid on top of the user's anticipated decoy web page content. This attack differs from a [CSRF](https://portswigger.net/web-security/csrf) attack in that the user is required to perform an action such as a button click whereas a [CSRF attack](https://portswigger.net/web-security/csrf) depends upon forging an entire request without the user's knowledge or input.

Protection against CSRF attacks is often provided by the use of a [CSRF token](https://portswigger.net/web-security/csrf#common-defences-against-csrf): a session-specific, single-use number or nonce. Clickjacking attacks are not mitigated by the CSRF token as a target session is established with content loaded from an authentic website and with all requests happening on-domain. CSRF tokens are placed into requests and passed to the server as part of a normally behaved session. The difference compared to a normal user session is that the process occurs within a hidden iframe.

# How to prevent clickjacking attacks

We have discussed a commonly encountered browser-side prevention mechanism, namely frame busting scripts. However, we have seen that it is often straightforward for an attacker to circumvent these protections. Consequently, server driven protocols have been devised that constrain browser iframe usage and mitigate against clickjacking.

Clickjacking is a browser-side behavior and its success or otherwise depends upon browser functionality and conformity to prevailing web standards and best practice. Server-side protection against clickjacking is provided by defining and communicating constraints over the use of components such as iframes. However, implementation of protection depends upon browser compliance and enforcement of these constraints. Two mechanisms for server-side clickjacking protection are X-Frame-Options and [Content Security Policy](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/content-security-policy).

### Content Security Policy ([CSP](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/content-security-policy))

Content Security Policy (CSP) is a detection and prevention mechanism that provides mitigation against attacks such as XSS and clickjacking. CSP is usually implemented in the web server as a return header of the form:
