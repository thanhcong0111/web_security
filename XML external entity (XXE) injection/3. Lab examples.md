# Some cases of XML external entity (XXE) injection

## 1. Exploiting XXE to perform SSRF attacks

Visit a product page, click `Check stock`, and intercept the resulting POST request in Burp Suite.

Insert the following external entity definition in between the XML declaration and the `stockCheck` element:

`<!DOCTYPE test [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "http://169.254.169.254/"> ]>`

Replace the `productId` number with a reference to the external entity: `&xxe`;. The response should contain `Invalid product ID:` followed by the response from the metadata endpoint, which will initially be a folder name.

Iteratively update the URL in the DTD to explore the API until you reach `/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/admin`. This should return JSON containing the `SecretAccessKey`.
