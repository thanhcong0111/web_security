# Some cases of Authentication

## 1. Password reset broken logic

Go to the website we want to attack and tap `Forgot your password?`. Then enter `username = wiener`. When checking Burp's Proxy side and look for `/forgotpasswor`, you can see the access command with `username = wiener`

Access to email client by click on `Email client`. Clicking on the link is transferred and change the new password (`password = 12345`)

After that, check Proxy and look for ` /forgot-password?temp-forgot-password-token`
then `send to repeater` to attack.

On repeater tab, change `temp-forgot-password-token=x` and `username=carlos`. Them `send` and `follow redirection`. At this momment, the new password was updated of wiener is become carlos.

We can check by log in with:
- Username: carlos
- Password: 12345 (new updated password of wiener)
