# Some cases of Server-side request forgery (SSRF)

## 1. Basic SSRF against the local server

Browse to `/admin` and observe that you can't directly access the admin page.

Visit a product, click "Check stock", intercept the request in Burp Suite, and send it to Burp Repeater.

Change the URL in the `stockApi` parameter to `http://localhost/admin`. This should display the administration interface.

Read the HTML to identify the URL to delete the target user, which is:

`http://localhost/admin/delete?username=carlos`

The carlos admin is deleted.

## 2. Basic SSRF against another back-end system

Change the `stockApi` of request to `stockApi=https://192.168.0.1:8080/` => return that `"Missing parameter"`

Modify the address to check that whether other applications are using this IP by changing the IP to `192.168.0.2`, `192.168.0.3`... => return no

To find the exact IP, use a sniper by setting the range from `192.168.0.1` to `192.168.0.255` because the maximum value for an IP address is 255.

After find the right IP address, add to `stockApi` with `stockApi=https://192.168.0.x:8080/admin` with x is the right IP address.

When open `render` of response, we can see the `admin panel`

Next, delete `carlos` admin encapsulation by adding in the response: `http://192.168.0.x:8080/admin/delete?username=carlos`

The carlos admin is deleted.

## 3. SSRF with blacklist-based input filter

Visit a product, click "Check stock", intercept the request in Burp Suite, and send it to Burp Repeater.

Change the URL in the stockApi parameter to `http://127.0.0.1/` and observe that the request is blocked. 

Bypass the block by changing the URL to: `http://127.1/`

Change the URL to `http://127.1/admin` and observe that the URL is blocked again.

Obfuscate the "a" by double-URL encoding it to %2561 to access the admin interface and delete the target user, it means: `http://127.1/%2561dmin`

#### Note: 
`127.0.0.1` is normally the IP address assigned to the "loopback" or local-only interface. This is a "fake" network adapter that can only communicate within the same host. It's often used when you want a network-capable application to only serve clients on the same host. A process that is listening on `127.0.0.1` for connections will only receive local connections on that socket.

## 4. SSRF with filter bypass via open redirection vulnerability

Visit a product, click "Check stock", intercept the request in Burp Suite, and send it to Burp Repeater.

Try tampering with the stockApi parameter and observe that it isn't possible to make the server issue the request directly to a different host.

Click "next product" and observe that the path parameter is placed into the Location header of a redirection response, resulting in an open redirection.

Create a URL that exploits the open redirection vulnerability, and redirects to the admin interface, and feed this into the stockApi parameter on the stock checker:

`/product/nextProduct?path=http://192.168.0.12:8080/admin`

Observe that the stock checker follows the redirection and shows you the admin page.
Amend the path to delete the target user:

`/product/nextProduct?path=http://192.168.0.12:8080/admin/delete?username=carlos`

The carlos admin is deleted.

## 5. SSRF with whitelist-based input filter

Visit a product, click "Check stock", intercept the request in Burp Suite, and send it to Burp Repeater.

Change the URL in the stockApi parameter to `http://127.0.0.1/` and observe that the application is parsing the URL, extracting the hostname, and validating it against a whitelist.

Change the URL to `http://username@stock.weliketoshop.net/` and observe that this is accepted, indicating that the URL parser supports embedded credentials.

Append a `#` to the username and observe that the URL is now rejected.

Double-URL encode the `#` to `%2523` (`http://username%2523@stock.weliketoshop.net/`) and observe the extremely suspicious "Internal Server Error" response, indicating that the server may have attempted to connect to "username".

To access the admin interface and delete the target user, change the URL to:

`http://localhost:80%2523@stock.weliketoshop.net/admin/delete?username=carlos`

The carlos admin is deleted.
