# Some cases of Server-side request forgery (SSRF)

## 1. Basic SSRF against the local server

Browse to `/admin` and observe that you can't directly access the admin page.

Visit a product, click "Check stock", intercept the request in Burp Suite, and send it to Burp Repeater.

Change the URL in the `stockApi` parameter to `http://localhost/admin`. This should display the administration interface.

Read the HTML to identify the URL to delete the target user, which is:

`http://localhost/admin/delete?username=carlos`

The carlos admin is deleted.

## 2. Basic SSRF against another back-end system

Change the `stockApi` of request to `stockApi=https://192.168.0.1:8080/` => return that `"Missing parameter"`

Modify the address to check that whether other applications are using this IP by changing the IP to `192.168.0.2`, `192.168.0.3`... => return no

To find the exact IP, use a sniper by setting the range from `192.168.0.1` to `192.168.0.255` because the maximum value for an IP address is 255.

After find the right IP address, add to `stockApi` with `stockApi=https://192.168.0.x:8080/admin` with x is the right IP address.

When open `render` of response, we can see the `admin panel`

Next, delete `carlos` admin encapsulation by adding in the response: `http://192.168.0.x:8080/admin/delete?username=carlos`

The carlos admin is deleted.
