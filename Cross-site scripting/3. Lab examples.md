# Some cases of Cross-site scripting

## 1. Stored XSS into HTML context with nothing encoded

Open the website and go to any. 

Scroll down to the comment section and leave a comment as follows:

- Comment: `<script>alert(1)</script>`
- Name: your name or a random name, such as: `ian`
- Email: a random email, such as: `ian@hacker.com`
- Website: `https://google.com`

Then choose to post comment.

## 2. Stored XSS into HTML context with nothing encoded

Enter the following into the comment box:
`<script>alert(1)</script>`

Enter a name, email and website.

Click "Post comment".

Go back to the blog.

## 3. DOM XSS in `document.write` sink using source `location.search`

Enter a random alphanumeric string into the search box.

Right-click and inspect the element, and observe that your random string has been placed inside an img src attribute.

Break out of the img attribute by searching for:
`"><svg onload=alert(1)>`

## 4. DOM XSS in `innerHTML` sink using source `location.search`

Enter the following into the into the search box:
`<img src=1 onerror=alert(1)>`

Click "Search".

The value of the src attribute is invalid and throws an error. This triggers the onerror event handler, which then calls the alert() function. As a result, the payload is executed whenever the user's browser attempts to load the page containing your malicious post.

## 5. DOM XSS in jQuery anchor `href` attribute sink using `location.search` source

On the Submit feedback page, change the query parameter `returnPath` to `/` followed by a random alphanumeric string.

Right-click and inspect the element, and observe that your random string has been placed inside an a `href` attribute.

Change `returnPath` to:

`javascript:alert(document.cookie)`

Hit enter and click "back".

## 6. DOM XSS in jQuery selector sink using a hashchange event

From the lab banner, open the exploit server.

In the Body section, add the following malicious `iframe`:

`<iframe src="https://YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/#" onload="this.src+='<img src=x onerror=print()>'"></iframe>`

Store the exploit, then click View exploit to confirm that the `print()` function is called.

Go back to the exploit server and click Deliver to victim to solve the lab.

## 7. Reflected XSS into attribute with angle brackets HTML-encoded

Submit a random alphanumeric string in the search box, then use Burp Suite to intercept the search request and send it to Burp Repeater.

Observe that the random string has been reflected inside a quoted attribute.

Replace your input with the following payload to escape the quoted attribute and inject an event handler:

`"onmouseover="alert(1)`

Verify the technique worked by right-clicking, selecting "Copy URL", and pasting the URL in the browser. When you move the mouse over the injected element it should trigger an alert.

## 8. Stored XSS into anchor `href` attribute with double quotes HTML-encoded

Post a comment with a random alphanumeric string in the "Website" input, then use Burp Suite to intercept the request and send it to Burp Repeater.

Make a second request in the browser to view the post and use Burp Suite to intercept the request and send it to Burp Repeater.

Observe that the random string in the second Repeater tab has been reflected inside an anchor `href` attribute.

Repeat the process again but this time replace your input with the following payload to inject a JavaScript URL that calls alert:

`javascript:alert(1)`

Verify the technique worked by right-clicking, selecting "Copy URL", and pasting the URL in the browser. Clicking the name above your comment should trigger an alert.

## 9. Reflected XSS into a JavaScript string with angle brackets HTML encoded

Submit a random alphanumeric string in the search box, then use Burp Suite to intercept the search request and send it to Burp Repeater.

Observe that the random string has been reflected inside a JavaScript string.

Replace your input with the following payload to break out of the JavaScript string and inject an alert:

`'-alert(1)-'`

Verify the technique worked by right clicking, selecting "Copy URL", and pasting the URL in the browser. When you load the page it should trigger an alert.

## 10. DOM XSS in `document.write` sink using source `location.search` inside a select element

On the product pages, right click to inspect if a storeId parameter from the location.search source. It then uses document.write to create a new option in the select element for the stock checker functionality.

Add a storeId query parameter to the URL and enter a random alphanumeric string as its value. It could likely: `product?productId=1&storeId=1`. Request this modified URL.

In the browser, notice that your random string is now listed as one of the options in the drop-down list.

Right-click and inspect the drop-down list to confirm that the value of your storeId parameter has been placed inside a select element.

Change the URL to include a suitable XSS payload inside the storeId parameter as follows:

`product?productId=1&storeId="></select><img%20src=1%20onerror=alert(1)>`

## 11. DOM XSS in AngularJS expression with angle brackets and double quotes HTML-encoded

Enter a random alphanumeric string into the search box.

View the page source and observe that your random string is enclosed in an `ng-app` directive.

Enter the following AngularJS expression in the search box:

`{{$on.constructor('alert(1)')()}}`

Click search.

## 12. Reflected DOM XSS

Go to the target website and use the search bar to search for a random test string, such as "XSS".

Return to the Proxy tool in Burp Suite and forward the request.

On the Intercept tab, notice that the string is reflected in a JSON response called search-results.

From the Site Map, open the `searchResults.js` file and notice that the JSON response is used with an `eval()` function call.

By experimenting with different search strings, you can identify that the JSON response is escaping quotation marks. However, backslash is not being escaped.

To solve this lab, enter the following search term:

`\"-alert(1)}//`

As you have injected a backslash and the site isn't escaping them, when the JSON response attempts to escape the opening double-quotes character, it adds a second backslash. The resulting double-backslash causes the escaping to be effectively canceled out. This means that the double-quotes are processed unescaped, which closes the string that should contain the search term.

An arithmetic operator (in this case the subtraction operator) is then used to separate the expressions before the `alert()` function is called. Finally, a closing curly bracket and two forward slashes close the JSON object early and comment out what would have been the rest of the object. As a result, the response is generated as follows:

`{"searchTerm":"\\"-alert(1)}//", "results":[]}`

## 13. Stored DOM XSS

Post a comment containing the following vector:

`<><img src=1 onerror=alert(1)>`

In an attempt to prevent XSS, the website uses the JavaScript replace() function to encode angle brackets. However, when the first argument is a string, the function only replaces the first occurrence. We exploit this vulnerability by simply including an extra set of angle brackets at the beginning of the comment. These angle brackets will be encoded, but any subsequent angle brackets will be unaffected, enabling us to effectively bypass the filter and inject HTML.
