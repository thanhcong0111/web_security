## 10. DOM XSS in document.write sink using source location.search inside a select element

On the product pages, right click to inspect if a storeId parameter from the location.search source. It then uses document.write to create a new option in the select element for the stock checker functionality.

Add a storeId query parameter to the URL and enter a random alphanumeric string as its value. It could likely: `product?productId=1&storeId=1`. Request this modified URL.

In the browser, notice that your random string is now listed as one of the options in the drop-down list.

Right-click and inspect the drop-down list to confirm that the value of your storeId parameter has been placed inside a select element.

Change the URL to include a suitable XSS payload inside the storeId parameter as follows:
`product?productId=1&storeId="></select><img%20src=1%20onerror=alert(1)>`
